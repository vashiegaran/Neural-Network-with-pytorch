# Neural-Network-with-pytorch
Simple Neural Network with Pytorch using handwritten numbers as data from torch

The implementation of this code is taken from Website(https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-neural-network-pytorch/)

Image-based dataset showing handwritten digits from 0-9 is used and a neural network model is built to classify them.

This project is for beginner to get familiar with pytorch and in the pdf file NeuralNetwork.pdf, each process and lines of code are explained detailed.
